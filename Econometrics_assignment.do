*1. Describe the data 

sum sector ys w k n

*2. Estimate an employment equation through an OLS regression with dependent variable n and regressors w and k. 



*3. Test the significance of coefficients on w and k and comment. 



*4. By using ys and/or sectoral indicators test the null of homogeneity across sectors 


*5. If you find evidence of sectoral heterogeneity, find a convenient way to accommodate it in your regression model. 



*6. Test the null of conditional homoskedasticity and comment. 




*7. If you find evidence of heteroskedasticity, find a way to address the issue and rerun regression analysis with the correction.
